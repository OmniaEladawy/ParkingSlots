It overcomes the problem of finding a parking space in commercial areas that unnecessary consumes time.
Hence this project offers a AI based reservation system connected to an android application where users can view various parking areas and select the space to view whether space is available or not.
If the booking space is available then he can book it for specific time slot. The booked space will be marked and will not be available for anyone else for the specified time. 
For demonstration we will be using 2 parking spaces and each parking space will have several time slots.This system provides an additional feature of cancelling the bookings.
User can cancel their books space anytime.Users can even make payment online via credit card.After making payment users are notified about the booking via email along with unique parking number.
The client app allows parking booking on android phone.The server side AI service is stored in a firebase. <br><br>
